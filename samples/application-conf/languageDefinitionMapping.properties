# This file maps the program file with the corresponding language definition properties file in the build-conf folder.

# For example: As shown below, the programs - epsnbrvl.cbl and epsmpmt.cbl will map to the language definition file 
# build-conf/langDefs/langDefProps01.properties and epscmort.cbl will map to the language definition file
# build-conf/langDefs/langDefProps02.properties.  

epsnbrvl.cbl=langDefProps01
epsmpmt.cbl=langDefProps01
epscmort.cbl=langDefProps02

# Insert all the file ==> language definition properties mapping here!
